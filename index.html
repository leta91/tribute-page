      <p>The key points of her life:</p>
     <ul>
       <li><span class="bold">1797</span>: Mary is born to William Godwin, philosopher who supports utilitarianism and anarchism, and Mary Wollstonecraft, feminist author of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", who dies ten days after childbirth</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1801</span>: William Godwin marries Mrs Mary Jane Clairmont. The enlarged family includes four children: a son and a daughter Jane, that will later call herself Claire, by Mrs Clairmont, Mary and her stepsister from her mother's side, Fanny</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1812</span>: Percy Bysshe Shelley, newly married to Harriet Westbrook, begins exchanging letters with Mr Godwin whose ideas he appreciates. Mary meets for the first time Percy Shelley and his wife when they visit her father in their family's home</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1814</span>: Mary begins a relationship with Percy Shelley while he is still married and expecting his second child by his wife</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1814-1843</span>: Throughout these three decades Mary, Percy and then their family, often bringing Claire as well, travel and reside overseas spanning from Italy, Germany and Switzerland etc.
        The literature and philosophy of these countries impact Mary on such an immense scale that she writes many biographical essays about these international promoters of the Arts (to name a few of the artistic minds she writes about: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Foscolo, Cervantes, Corneille, Racine, Voltaire, Rousseau)  
       <li><span class="bold">1815-1822</span>: In this arc of time tragedies strike Mary and Percy's lives as Mary suffers several miscarriages, her and Shelley's young children die, Fanny commits suicide and Percy's wife is found drowned </li>
       <li><span class="bold">1816</span>: The family, with her sister by marriage Claire, go to Geneva. They meet Byron (with whom Claire has already formed a <em>liaison</em>). At the end of the year Mary and Percy marry</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1816-1818</span>: Her most inspiring novel <em>"Frankenstein"</em> (which is regarded worlwide as one of the timeless cornerstones of English literature) is started, completed and published.
      In this novel Mary mixes phylosophical elements, medical experiments performed in that age, Greek mythology, the desire of Man to extend his knowledge to the extreme to the point of trying to play God in the creation of Frankenstein </li>
       <li><strong>1819</strong>: Mary gives birth to a son, William Florence who is the only child of the couple reaching adulthood</li>
       <li><strong>1822</strong>: Percy is lost at sea in a storm in Leghorn, Tuscany </li>
       <li><strong>1823</strong>: The second edition of <em>"Frankenstein"</em> is published and Mary is finally mentioned as the author of this literary masterpiece. Originally in the first edition of "Frankenstein" she was not cited as the author, due to the fact of being a woman and she had to fight to obtain the respect and legitimacy of her works</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1824-1839</span>: Mary Shelley writes numerous articles and stories for several magazines and journals </li>
       <li><span class="bold">1837</span>: Mary Shelley publishes her last novel</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1851</span>: Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley dies in London</li>
